## üö® Git & Version Control Rules

### **Rule #1: No Automatic Commits/Pushes**
**CRITICAL**: Never automatically commit and push changes without explicit confirmation from the project owner.

- Always ask for confirmation before running `git commit` or `git push`
- Present changes clearly and wait for approval
- Only commit when explicitly requested
- This ensures full control over what goes into the repository

### Git Workflow
1. Make changes to files as requested
2. Show/explain what was changed
3. **WAIT** for explicit confirmation to commit
4. Only then run `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push`

## üìÅ Project Structure Guidelines

### Documentation Standards
- Keep all documentation in the `_docs/` folder
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Follow markdown formatting standards
- Update relevant docs when making changes

### Asset Organization
- Logo files: `assets/images/logo/`
- Icons: `assets/icons/`
- Create folders as needed, no .gitkeep files
- Use web-optimized formats (WebP, SVG preferred)

## üé® Development Standards

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons (functional only, no decorative)
- **Approach**: Component-thinking for future Laravel/Alpine.js migration
- **Language**: Dutch content for pigeon racing community

### Code Quality
- Use semantic HTML structure
- Implement accessibility standards (AA/AAA compliance)
- Mobile-first responsive design
