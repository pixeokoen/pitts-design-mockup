# Static Mockup Development Manifest
## Technical Approach for Multi-Content Website

---

### **1. Technology Stack Methodology**

#### **Tailwind CSS Approach**
- **Utility-first development**: Use Tailwind utilities directly in HTML for rapid iteration and changes
- **No custom CSS initially**: Avoid writing custom CSS during mockup phase to maintain flexibility
- **Component-class patterns**: Establish consistent utility combinations for repeated elements
- **Responsive-first**: Build mobile-first, then enhance for larger screens using Tailwind's prefixes
- **Configuration minimal**: Use default Tailwind config initially, customize only when moving to production

#### **HTML Structure Strategy**
- **Component-thinking**: Structure HTML with future Alpine.js components in mind
- **Semantic foundation**: Use proper HTML5 semantic elements for structure and accessibility
- **Data-ready**: Include Alpine.js directives that will enhance interactivity
- **Modular approach**: Create reusable HTML blocks that can be easily enhanced with Alpine.js
- **No build process**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS for immediate feedback and rapid iteration

---

### **2. Development Approach**

#### **Mockup-First Principles**
- **Static before dynamic**: Build complete static versions before adding any interactivity
- **Content-agnostic**: Focus on structure and layout patterns, not specific content
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start with basic HTML/CSS, layer on Alpine.js features
- **Client-feedback ready**: Ensure mockups can be easily shared and reviewed
- **Migration-prepared**: Structure code for easy conversion to Laravel/Alpine.js architecture

---

### **3. File Structure Methodology**

#### **Component Organization**
- **Template-based**: Create HTML templates that work seamlessly with Alpine.js directives
- **Separation of concerns**: Keep layout, content, and behavior separate during mockup phase
- **Naming conventions**: Use consistent naming that translates to Alpine.js component patterns
- **Reusability focus**: Build HTML blocks that can be reused across different page types
- **Documentation embedded**: Include comments that explain Alpine.js component boundaries and data

#### **Page Structure Approach**
- **Layout inheritance**: Create base layouts that can be extended by specific page types
- **Content patterns**: Establish patterns for different content types without specific styling
- **Navigation consistency**: Maintain consistent navigation patterns across all pages
- **URL structure**: Plan URL patterns that will work with future Laravel routing

---

### **4. Tailwind CSS Methodology**

#### **Utility Application Strategy**
- **Rapid iteration**: Apply utilities directly in HTML for quick visual feedback
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify repeated utility combinations that will become components
- **Responsive patterns**: Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes consistently across similar elements
- **State variations**: Use Tailwind's state variants (hover, focus, active) to prototype interactions
- **No extraction initially**: Avoid extracting components or creating custom CSS during mockup phase

#### **Class Organization**
- **Logical grouping**: Group related utilities (layout, typography, colors) for readability
- **Consistent patterns**: Use same utility combinations for similar elements across pages
- **Documentation approach**: Comment complex utility combinations for future reference
- **Migration preparation**: Structure classes for easy integration with Alpine.js directives

---

### **5. Content Structure Approach**

#### **Data Structure Planning**
- **Content-type agnostic**: Create structures that work for any content type
- **API-ready**: Structure HTML with future API data consumption in mind using Alpine.js
- **Placeholder content**: Use consistent placeholder patterns that can be easily replaced
- **Alpine.js directives**: Include x-data, x-show, x-on directives for future interactivity
- **Relationship mapping**: Plan how different content types relate to each other

#### **Interactive Element Planning**
- **Behavior placeholders**: Include interactive elements with placeholder behaviors
- **State representation**: Show different states (loading, error, success) statically
- **Form structure**: Create form layouts that can be enhanced with Alpine.js validation
- **Navigation patterns**: Establish navigation patterns that work with Alpine.js state management

---

### **6. Laravel/Alpine.js Migration Strategy**

#### **Component Preparation**
- **Boundary identification**: Clearly identify what will become Alpine.js components
- **Data planning**: Structure x-data attributes for Alpine.js reactive state
- **Event planning**: Design interactions that will become Alpine.js x-on handlers
- **State identification**: Plan what data will need to be reactive in Alpine.js
- **Directive preparation**: Design areas that will use Alpine.js directives (x-show, x-if, x-for)

#### **Laravel Integration Planning**
- **Blade template structure**: Organize HTML for easy conversion to Blade templates with Alpine.js
- **Route planning**: Design URL structure that matches Laravel routing conventions
- **Data flow planning**: Structure content to match future database relationships
- **Asset organization**: Plan asset structure for Laravel's asset pipeline (Vite) with Alpine.js
- **TALL Stack**: Prepare for Tailwind + Alpine.js + Laravel integration

---

### **7. Development Workflow**

#### **Iteration Methodology**
- **Page-by-page approach**: Complete one page type fully before moving to next
- **Component identification**: Mark reusable elements during development
- **Pattern documentation**: Document utility patterns as they emerge
- **Migration notes**: Include comments about future Laravel/Alpine.js conversion

#### **File Organization Strategy**
```
project-root/
├── _docs/
│   └── static-mockup-manifest.md
├── templates/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── layouts/
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   └── icons/
├── js/
│   └── alpine-components.js
└── index.html
```

#### **Asset Organization Principles**
- **Create folders when needed**: Only create asset directories when you have files to put in them
- **No empty folder tracking**: Avoid .gitkeep files or unnecessary placeholder files during mockup phase
- **Progressive structure**: Build file organization as content is added, not preemptively
- **Simplicity first**: Keep file structure minimal during rapid iteration phase

#### **Quality Control Approach**
- **Validation**: HTML/CSS validation during development
- **Accessibility**: Basic accessibility testing during mockup phase
- **Responsive testing**: Test on actual devices, not just browser DevTools
- **Performance awareness**: Monitor file sizes and loading times

---

### **8. Team Collaboration Methodology**

#### **Handoff Preparation**
- **Documentation**: Document component patterns and utility combinations
- **Code comments**: Include migration notes and Alpine.js component boundaries
- **Asset organization**: Prepare assets for easy Laravel integration
- **Pattern library**: Create reference of established patterns

#### **Feedback Integration**
- **Iterative approach**: Plan for multiple feedback cycles
- **Change documentation**: Track pattern changes and decisions
- **Version control**: Use git effectively for collaboration
- **Migration planning**: Keep migration considerations in all decisions

---

### **9. Alpine.js Integration Strategy**

#### **Progressive Enhancement Approach**
- **Start static**: Build fully functional static HTML first
- **Add interactivity**: Layer Alpine.js directives for dynamic behavior
- **Component patterns**: Establish reusable Alpine.js component patterns
- **State management**: Plan for Alpine.js stores for shared state
- **Performance**: Keep Alpine.js usage lightweight and focused

#### **Common Alpine.js Patterns**
- **Mobile menu**: x-data for toggle state, x-show for visibility
- **Dropdowns**: x-data for open state, x-on:click for interactions
- **Search**: x-data for query state, x-on:input for real-time updates
- **Forms**: x-data for form state, x-on:submit for handling
- **Notifications**: x-data for message state, x-transition for animations

#### **Laravel Blade Integration**
- **Server-side data**: Pass Laravel data to Alpine.js via x-data
- **CSRF tokens**: Include Laravel CSRF tokens in Alpine.js forms
- **Route helpers**: Use Laravel route helpers with Alpine.js navigation
- **Localization**: Integrate Laravel translations with Alpine.js
